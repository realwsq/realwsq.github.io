            <p> It's a little demo for my Numerical Analysis class. I'm going to solve the linear system by applying Gaussian elimination using 4-digit arithmetic with rounding. </p>
            <p> However, a huge error happens. </p>
            <p> By theoritical analysis (It is left out here:)), we find the trouble maker and fix the problem by switching the row or the column of the linear system. </p>
            <p> This little demo is going to show the big improvement of the naive solution and the modified solution.
                We can simply press the "naive solution button" to see the specific process of Gaussian Elimination and press the "modified solution" button to easily compare the difference. 
                In the modified solution we change the columns and it's obvious that our relative error is much smaller. </p>
            <p> You can also see more general cases by changing the coefficient. </p>
